# Companion Repository for course "Writing Maintainable UI Test Automation with Appium"
This repo contains the code samples I used in my Pluralsight course "Writing Maintainable UI Test Automation with Appium"
The master branch contains the starting point of the course.

Each module adresses another technique to create more maintainable test code.
This repo contains multiple branches that show the result after one pass of refactorying applying one of the paterns or practices discussed in the course.

There are the following branches:
* Demo_DRY -> Result after applying the Don't Repeat Yourself Principle
* Demo_SRP -> Result after applying the Single Responsibility Principle
* Demo_PageObjects -> Results after further applying Single Responsiblity with the use of Page Objects
* Demo_ScreenPlay -> Results after applying the screenplay pattern
